### Question: Dispersion of Contaminants and Public Health Policy

**a.** A factory releases a pollutant at a constant rate. Using the simplified dispersion formula \( C_{max} = \frac{Q}{UWH} \), where \( Q \) is in kg/s, \( U \) is m/s, \( W \) is in m, and \( H \) is in m, calculate the maximum ground-level concentration of the pollutant at a certain distance downwind from the source. Provide sample calculations for a scenario with given parameters. **[5 marks]**

**b.** Convert the concentration of a pollutant from ppm to mg/m³ and discuss how these units relate to threshold limit values used in environmental regulations. **[5 marks]**

**c.** Reflect on the challenges of establishing environmental regulations for air quality in rapidly developing urban areas, considering factors such as industrial growth, population density, and economic priorities. **[10 marks]**

**d.** Critically assess the role of environmental engineers in shaping public health policy to ensure the well-being of populations in the face of industrial pollution. **[5 marks]**

### Question: Diserpsion of Pollutants and Atmospheric Stability

A 110m chimney produces sulphur dioxide from an industrial plant inland from the city.  At 2am December 15th, a weather anemometer measures calm winds of 2.5m/s and very little cloud is visible. 

**a.** State the atmospheric stability class  

**b.** The mixing depth is at 45m. Describe in 3 sentences what is likely to happen to the contaminants from the chimney during the night, mentioning probable wind direction. Sketch a graph of air temperature vs height. 

**c.** As the sun rises the low-lying moist air then mixes with the sulphur dioxide (SO2) in a concentration of 8mg/m3, eventually creating H2SO4. The short-term maximum recommended exposure to sulphur dioxide is 5ppm.  

**d.** 	Calculate the concentration in ppm of the pollutant and decide whether this poses a significant health risk. **[10 marks]** 

**e.** Explain why the rising of the sun can alter the stability class of the atmosphere **[5 marks]**
