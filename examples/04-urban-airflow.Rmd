# Urban Airflow


### Question 1: Urban Pollution Dynamics and Meteorological Conditions

The bustling metropolis of Shanghai is experiencing a rapid increase in vehicular emissions. At 5 am in early spring, traffic is already bustling, and a thermal inversion is observed with a temperature of 10°C at the surface and 14°C at 200m altitude.

**a.** Identify the type of temperature inversion observed and its typical atmospheric stability class. [5 marks]

**b.** Given the height of the inversion layer is at 150m, explain in detail how this inversion may affect the dispersion of vehicle exhaust pollutants in the early morning hours. Provide a graph of the expected pollutant concentration profile with height. [10 marks]

**c.** Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the primary pollutants from vehicles, and it starts reacting with the morning sunlight to form ozone (O3). Describe their implications for local air quality. [10 marks]

**d.** The average NO2 concentration at street level is recorded at 40µg/m³. Convert this concentration to ppm and discuss if this level is considered safe according to the WHO guidelines for urban areas. Calculate whether this level poses a health risk for sensitive populations such as children and the elderly. [10 marks]

**e.** Discuss the phenomenon of photochemical smog and how the rising sun's interaction with vehicular emissions can lead to its formation. Explain the environmental and health effects of photochemical smog. [10 marks]

### Question 2: Industrial Emissions and Seasonal Changes in Air Quality

A steel manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh, USA is situated in a valley and operates continuously throughout the year. During the autumn, the plant's emissions include particulate matter (PM10) and carbon monoxide (CO).

**a.** Given that the region is experiencing a stable autumn anticyclone, determine the likely atmospheric stability class during a clear, calm night. [5 marks]

**b.** The emissions from the plant's chimney, at 90m tall, are being released into a stable night-time atmosphere with a wind speed of 0.5m/s and mixing depth of 100m. Describe the likely dispersion pattern of the PM10 and CO throughout the night, incorporating the valley's topographical effects. Provide a diagram to illustrate your answer. [10 marks]

**c.** As the morning fog lifts, there is an increase in wind speed and vertical mixing. Quantify the dilution effect on a PM10 concentration of 150µg/m³ using a simple box-model, assuming the wind speed doubles and the mixing depth increases to 500m. [10 marks]

**d.** Carbon monoxide has a WHO 8-hour exposure limit of 10mg/m³. If the CO concentration at ground level near the plant is measured at 12mg/m³, calculate the concentration in ppm and assess the compliance with health standards, considering the change in atmospheric conditions from night to morning. [10 marks]

**e.** Discuss the role of seasonal weather patterns in influencing air quality, especially in industrial regions with complex terrain. Consider the impact on regulatory compliance and community health. [10 marks]
