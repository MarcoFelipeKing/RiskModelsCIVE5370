# Health Effects and Regulations

### Question 1: Air Quality Standards and Health Impact Assessment

*Discuss the importance of air quality standards in protecting public health. Choose a specific pollutant and calculate the excess risk of a health outcome given a certain exposure level above the WHO guideline limit.*

**a.** Define what is meant by an 'air quality standard' and explain how it is used to protect public health. ****[5 marks]****

**b.** The WHO air quality guideline for PM2.5 is 10 µg/m³ annual mean. Calculate the excess risk of asthma in children exposed to an annual mean PM2.5 concentration of 25 µg/m³, given that the relative risk (RR) of asthma increase is 1.05 per 10 µg/m³ PM2.5. Assume a baseline asthma incidence of 3%. **[10 marks]**

**c.** Critically discuss how such standards might be adjusted or implemented in a rapidly developing urban area in China, considering economic and social factors. **[10 marks]**

### Question 2: Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality in Buildings

*Ventilation is key to maintaining indoor air quality. Describe the role of ventilation in mitigating indoor air pollution and calculate the necessary air exchange rate for a specific scenario.*

**a.** Explain the principles of ventilation and its role in controlling indoor air pollution. **[5 marks]**

**b.** A room measuring 5m x 4m x 3m with an occupancy of 3 people needs to maintain CO2 levels below 1000 ppm. Given that each person exhales approximately 0.005 m³ of CO2 per hour, calculate the necessary ventilation rate (in air changes per hour) to maintain the target CO2 level, assuming the outdoor CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. [10 marks]

**c.** Discuss the challenges of implementing effective ventilation in densely populated urban environments where external air quality may be poor. [10 marks]

### Question 3: Air Pollution Exposure and Disease Burden

*Evaluate the burden of disease attributable to air pollution and propose a model to estimate disease burden in a specific population.*

**a.** Briefly describe the concept of 'burden of disease' and how it is quantified in environmental health. **[5 marks]**

**b.** Given data on exposure to NO2 with an attributable fraction (AF) for respiratory infections of 0.2, and an incidence rate of respiratory infections in the population of 0.04, calculate the attributable number of cases per year in a city with a population of 10 million. [10 marks]

**c.** Design a basic model framework to estimate the burden of cardiovascular diseases attributable to air pollution in urban settings. Discuss the data requirements and potential limitations of your model. [10 marks]

### Question 4: Environmental Policy and Air Quality Management

*Analyze the relationship between environmental policy, air quality management, and engineering solutions to air pollution.*

**a.** Discuss the role of environmental policy in shaping air quality management strategies. **[5 marks]**

**b.** Describe two engineering solutions for urban air quality management and evaluate their effectiveness. [10 marks]

**c.** Considering global initiatives like the Paris Agreement, discuss the implications for urban air quality policies and management in the context of climate change mitigation. [10 marks]

### Question 5: Impact of Urbanization on Air Quality

*Urbanization has significant implications for air quality. Assess the impact and suggest mitigation strategies applicable to a diverse cohort.*

**a.** Outline the major ways in which urbanization affects air quality. **[5 marks]**

**b.** Calculate the increase in NOx emissions given the following data: An urban area sees a daily increase in car traffic from 100,000 to 150,000 vehicles, with an average NOx emission rate of 0.4g/km per vehicle and an average travel distance of 30 km per vehicle per day. [10 marks]

**c.** Propose two culturally sensitive mitigation strategies that could be adopted in cities with diverse populations, like those in China, to address the air quality challenges presented by urbanization. [10 marks]
