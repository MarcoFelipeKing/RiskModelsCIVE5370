# How to use this book?

This booklet contains a selection of past paper questions from previous years including some from online exams. All questions are worth 25 marks but are broken down into sub-questions in the same way you will see in your exam. These are a mixture of calcualtion as well as discursive answers. You should write in full sentences unless told to do so otherwise. You are given partial marks for correct methods but incorrect answers. In any question where you think you need to make an appropriate assumptions, please do so and make it clear to the examinar what assumption you have made.
