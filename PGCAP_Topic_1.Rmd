## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data}
df <- read_excel(path = "micro_teach_feedback.xlsx") %>% janitor::clean_names()
df

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r df, echo=FALSE}
df %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols=c(b_bridge_in:s_summary),.fns = as.factor))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
